# knex-practise-pluralSight

This is a project to further improve on my understanding of how Knex works. Tutorial code-along from Plural Sight - an online learning modality.

I further familiarised myself with the use of sqlite3, and how to initialise an sqlite3 database, as well as to populate the sqlite3 database using the DB Browser application. I also created a database in PG using psql.

I also learnt to utilise prettyjson to improve the appearance of the data on the terminal.
