# knex-practise-pluralSight

This is a project to further improve on my understanding instantiating databases, creating schemae and populating them. In addition, used Knex.js to retrieve data and to debug. PluralSight used as guide.

sqlite3: Initialised an sqlite3 database. Populated the sqlite3 database using the DB Browser application.

postgreSQL: Created identical database & schema in PQ. PSQL used to populate scheme.

prettyjson: Utilised improve the appearance of the data on the terminal.

treeize: Familiarised myself the use of treeize to create a object/tree data structure.

Promise.all: Used instead of treeize to create the desired object/tree data structure. Also, to improve efficiency of query.

Use of config files and .gitignore.
